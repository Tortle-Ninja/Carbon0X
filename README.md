#  CarbonShell

## Introduction

CarbonOX is a side project inside Tortle Ninja to make __Tortle Carbon Negative__ (to emit less than zero carbon dioxide and carbon dioxide equivalent greenhouse gasses. ItÂ´s the intention of the team to make this initiative open to all the Fantom Ecosystem.

This project has 2 differentiated parts:

- Calculate our carbon footprint, that can be separated into 2 different streams: Onchain and Off-Chain. On-chain is easy to calculate, for OffChain (that means all the operative costs of Tortle: Travel, office...) we will relay on different providers, letting this integration open, so any developer can change to any other provider or even create an oracle solution, to calculate it based on different fonts aggregated.

- Create a transactional system that every certain time will send funds directly to an array of Carbon Sink projects, as on the rest of Carbon0x these projects are an open list, inside an open governance system.
